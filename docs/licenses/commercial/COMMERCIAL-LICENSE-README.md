# Commercial License Usage

This project is dual-licensed:

- **PolyForm Noncommercial License** (default, for research, education, personal projects).
- **Commercial License** (required for business, SaaS, or proprietary use).

## Which Commercial License Document Should I Use?

- **Short-Form Commercial License Grant** (`Commercial_License_Short_Form.docx`)  
  Use this for **small businesses, startups, or straightforward deals**. It is a one-page license grant that covers basic terms (rights, restrictions, fees, liability).

- **Long-Form Commercial License Agreement** (`Commercial_License_Long_Form.docx`)  
  Use this for **enterprise clients or complex deals**. It includes full terms such as indemnification, governing law, renewal terms, and support obligations.

## Customization

Both documents are **templates**:  
- Replace `[Your Name / Company]`, `[Client Company Name]`, `[Project Name]`, and placeholders for **fees, terms, and jurisdiction**.  
- Convert DOCX to PDF before sending for signature.
