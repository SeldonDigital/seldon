We welcome contributions! However, to ensure consistency and quality:

- All changes must be submitted as **pull requests (PRs)** to this repository.
- Forks may exist for personal use or experimentation, but only this
  repository is the **official source of truth**.
- By contributing, you agree that your changes will be governed by the
  same license and included in the upstream project.
- Significant contributions may require signing a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
